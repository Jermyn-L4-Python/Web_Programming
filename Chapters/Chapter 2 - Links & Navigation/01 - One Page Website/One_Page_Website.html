    <h2>Plot</h2>
    <p>
        Years after a rebellion spurred by a stolen bride to be and the blind ambitions of a mad King, Robert of the house 
        Baratheon (Mark Addy) sits on the much desired Iron Throne. In the mythical land of Westeros, nine noble families 
        fight for every inch of control and every drop of power. The King's Hand, Jon Arryn (Sir John Standing), is dead. And 
        Robert seeks out his only other ally in all of Westeros, his childhood friend Lord Eddard "Ned" Stark. The solemn and 
        honorable Warden of the North is tasked to depart his frozen sanctuary and join the King in the capital of King's Landing 
        to help the now overweight and drunk Robert rule. However, a letter in the dead of night informs "Ned" that the former 
        Hand was murdered, and that Robert will be next. So noble Ned goes against his better desires in an attempt to save his 
        friend and the kingdoms. But political intrigue, plots, murders, and sexual desires lead to a secret that could tear the 
        Seven Kingdoms apart. And soon Eddard will find out what happens when you play the Game of Thrones.

    <h2>Critical Reviews</h2>
    <p id = "crit">"What can be said about Game of Thrones that hasn't already been said? It's universally thought as 
        one of the best series in the histroy of television"
    
        <br><br>

        "Game of Thrones boasts an intricate plot with complex characters, stunning cinematography, 
        and intense action sequences, especially its many battles and fights." 

        <br><br>

        "It was a master piece. It was written to the perfection. It was mesmerizing. It was gripping." 
        
        <br><br>
    
        "At first I did not want to watch the series. But once I started watching it, I couldn't stop. 
        It became more and more exciting from season 1-8."

        <br><br>

        "Seasons 1-6: outstanding. Deep world-building, intelligent dialogue, epic set-pieces worthy of 
        Hollywood, expert acting, detailed plotting, genuine surprises, great soundtrack used sparingly. 
        GoT is worth watching for these seasons, definitely."

        <br><br>

        "I don't believe there has ever been anything like 'Game of Thrones' on TV. The sheer amount of 
        quality and talent in this series is staggering. The actors (and I mean really ALL the actors), 
        the costumes, the visual effects, the make-up: everybody working on this show seems to have wanted 
        to make Television-history. And the writing is just phenomenal."

        <br><br>

        "Game of Thrones' may belong to the 'Fantasy' genre, but the world of Westeros and its surrounding 
        lands has been so amazingly well thought through and is inhabited by characters that are so well drawn 
        and credible that everything you watch feels real."
