    <h2>Critical Reviews</h2>
    <p id = "crit">"What can be said about Game of Thrones that hasn't already been said? It's universally thought as 
        one of the best series in the histroy of television"
    
        <br><br>

        "Game of Thrones boasts an intricate plot with complex characters, stunning cinematography, 
        and intense action sequences, especially its many battles and fights." 

        <br><br>

        "It was a master piece. It was written to the perfection. It was mesmerizing. It was gripping." 
        
        <br><br>
    
        "At first I did not want to watch the series. But once I started watching it, I couldn't stop. 
        It became more and more exciting from season 1-8."

        <br><br>

        "Seasons 1-6: outstanding. Deep world-building, intelligent dialogue, epic set-pieces worthy of 
        Hollywood, expert acting, detailed plotting, genuine surprises, great soundtrack used sparingly. 
        GoT is worth watching for these seasons, definitely."

        <br><br>

        "I don't believe there has ever been anything like 'Game of Thrones' on TV. The sheer amount of 
        quality and talent in this series is staggering. The actors (and I mean really ALL the actors), 
        the costumes, the visual effects, the make-up: everybody working on this show seems to have wanted 
        to make Television-history. And the writing is just phenomenal."

        <br><br>

        "Game of Thrones' may belong to the 'Fantasy' genre, but the world of Westeros and its surrounding 
        lands has been so amazingly well thought through and is inhabited by characters that are so well drawn 
        and credible that everything you watch feels real."
