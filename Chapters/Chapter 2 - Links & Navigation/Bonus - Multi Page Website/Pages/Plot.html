        <h2>Plot</h2>
        <p>
            Years after a rebellion spurred by a stolen bride to be and the blind ambitions of a mad King, Robert of the house 
            Baratheon (Mark Addy) sits on the much desired Iron Throne. In the mythical land of Westeros, nine noble families 
            fight for every inch of control and every drop of power. The King's Hand, Jon Arryn (Sir John Standing), is dead. And 
            Robert seeks out his only other ally in all of Westeros, his childhood friend Lord Eddard "Ned" Stark. The solemn and 
            honorable Warden of the North is tasked to depart his frozen sanctuary and join the King in the capital of King's Landing 
            to help the now overweight and drunk Robert rule. However, a letter in the dead of night informs "Ned" that the former 
            Hand was murdered, and that Robert will be next. So noble Ned goes against his better desires in an attempt to save his 
            friend and the kingdoms. But political intrigue, plots, murders, and sexual desires lead to a secret that could tear the 
            Seven Kingdoms apart. And soon Eddard will find out what happens when you play the Game of Thrones.
